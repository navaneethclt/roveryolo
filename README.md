This project is an embedded application designed to perform real-time object detection and sensor data integration, using a YOLO model for detecting objects and a camera feed for image capture. The application processes data from sensors such as LIDAR through Arduino serial communication, applying a Butterworth low-pass filter to smooth sensor signals. It sends control signals based on the results of the object detection and sensor analysis. The system saves frames during the process for post-analysis and logs the sensor and control data to a CSV file for further review. The application requires a Windows OS due to its use of Windows-specific APIs for performance monitoring and process management, and it relies on OpenCV for image handling and manipulation. Additionally, an Arduino device is necessary for serial communication to read LIDAR data, and the YOLO object detection model is loaded in ONNX format. The program sets the process priority to real-time to maintain synchronization and performance, and it manages frame processing to maintain a stable frame rate. With the ability to read and control external hardware in real-time, the application is geared toward tasks requiring both object detection and sensor-based decision-making.
